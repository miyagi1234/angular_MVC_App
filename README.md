# angular_MVC_App
C# MVC using angularjs for frontend

***Things that might cause the solution to not build***

The packages wern't added, since there are too many files to upload.

When uploading the scripts, only the angularjs local/language files that is normaly in folder i18n was not copied as
there is just way too many files.


***PS***

There is a nod config file package.json, which could be used to reference angular and then gain these files.

I did create this application myself for those who doubt me my only assistant in getting it done was good old Google.
